# Run instructions

The runs can be validated by opening the `.ipynb' files in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
One run takes around 10 to 30 minutes.
The runs have three dependencies, namely [nlu_datasets](https://github.com/rikhuijzer/nlu_datasets), [improv](https://github.com/rikhuijzer/nlu_datasets) and the rasa_nlu PIP package.
Commits and package versions used by the run are listed in the notebook.
If errors occur, please make sure that the correct commit or version is used.
